== Kafka metrics

Kafka binder module exposes the following metrics:

`spring.cloud.stream.binder.kafka.someGroup.someTopic.lag`  - this metric indicates how many messages
have not been yet consumed from given binder's topic (`someTopic`) by given consumer group (`someGroup`).
For example if the value of the metric `spring.cloud.stream.binder.kafka.myGroup.myTopic.lag` is `1000`, then
consumer group `myGroup` has `1000` messages to waiting to be consumed from topic `myTopic`. This metric is
particularly useful to provide auto-scaling feedback to PaaS platform of your choice.
